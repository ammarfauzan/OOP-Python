- Objects are self-contained entities that contain both data and functions. Classes are blueprints for creating objects.

## Some of the common term in OOP
1. Classes : Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the structure and behavior of objects. Like a blueprint of the Home
2. Objects : Objects are instances of classes. They contain both data and functions. Like concrete Home, Ammar's home
